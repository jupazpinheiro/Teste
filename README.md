:checkered_flag:Backend [completed] :checkered_flag: -this repository


Backend was developed in Web API to be better consumed by frontend languages.
All necessary endpoints were developed and tested in execution (swagger)
<br/><br/><br/><br/>
:rotating_light:FrontEnd [incomplete]
<br/>
<b>Angular</b>
[Repository](https://github.com/jupazpinheiro/CalculateVat.UI)
<br/>
I started coding in angular as it was one of the suggested languages. Because I never coded I wasted time reading documentation and trying out new features.
<br/><br/>
<b>React</b>
[Repository](https://github.com/jupazpinheiro/CalculateVat.React.UI)
<br/>
I chose the React language because it is a language better known to me. I couldn't code all the necessary components
<br/><br/>

<b>Instructions</b>
1. clone this Repository
2. clone one frontend
3. Start backend<br/>
3.1 React : npm start<br/>
3.2 Angular : ng g serve<br/>

:+1:Strong points <br/>
* choose api for differents fronts
* all languages in last versions force me to read documents and update my knowledge
* chance to try a new language (Angular)

:-1: Points to improve <br/>
* unit tests (AAAs)
* finish front (second radiobutton)
